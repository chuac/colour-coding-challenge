# Colour Coding Challenge for B2Me

## Description
Draws a 1280x640 canvas containing 32,768 5px squares, each filled with discrete colours from rgb(8, 8, 8) to rgb(256, 256, 256).

There are two randomly generated designs to choose from: "Wave from Randomness" and "Silicon Wafers".

## Project setup
First, make sure Node and npm are installed on your machine.
Then run `npm install`, `npm run serve`, and access the app locally at `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Live demo
I have also hosted a live demo [here](https://colour-coding.chuac.me/).
